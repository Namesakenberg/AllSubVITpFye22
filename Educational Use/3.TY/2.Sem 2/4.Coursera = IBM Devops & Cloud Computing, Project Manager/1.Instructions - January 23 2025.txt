Dear Students,
As I told you in the classroom you have to upload the weekly report of coursera. Here I am sharing the drive folder link to upload weekly updates regarding coursera course. Create folder RollNo_Name and create excel sheet-->write weekly updates which track you have completed. Also upload the screenshots in your folder for the same.
