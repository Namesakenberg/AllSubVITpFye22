Dear students,
  Please find the  EDI/Major project Guide allocation google sheet . Please go through it and should complete the following  task on or before 27th Jan 2025.


                       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18SmkYSYlkZP2bwIQoZNfggQHbZNkT3qB/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111312471133855392951&rtpof=true&sd=true

 

1.     Discuss the problem statement with your guide and finalize your EDI/Major project idea, which should be original and address socially relevant concerns.



2.     Finalized topics should be entered/updated in the shared Google sheet. 



3.     Submit the FF180  form to me ( project topic + synopsis). I've attached a blank FF180 form for your convenience. There will be one form per group. Only the group that submits the FF180 will be considered for further processing.  




4.     Maintain a log book for recording every interaction/meeting with your EDI/Major project guide.

5.  MSE review for projects will be scheduled very soon .
